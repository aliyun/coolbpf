//! Deterministic grounding engine for causal attribution.

//! Runs before any LLM call and answers the questions that do not need
//! semantic understanding: did a tool call fail, and can a factual claim be
//! traced to an upstream observation. The LLM is then asked only about the
//! residue, which keeps a trivially-correct trajectory from being flagged at
//! all.
//!
//! Rules come from `attribution_decision_spec.md`, derived from a full scan of
//! 594 collected trajectories (14,852 steps, 12,368 tool results) rather than
//! from guesswork.

//! Terminology: a *claim* here is a factual assertion an agent made, unrelated
//! to LLM tokens.
